hail an Uber via SMS

## How to Use

2) Register your number on the website
3) send a sms with this format 
Pickup Location : Destination Location
i.e - 619 E University Ave Ann Arbor MI : 2260 HAYWARD ST

##Disclaimer
In alpha. No option to cancel the uber, so you'll have to pull out your phone to do so.
The code is extremely sloppy as well, don't make too much fun of me.
